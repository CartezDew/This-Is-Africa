This is Africa! is an engaging and educational trivia game that tests your knowledge about African history, geography, and culture. Players choose a region (Africa, Rwanda, or South Africa) and a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) to answer fun and challenging trivia questions. The game is designed to be both informative and entertaining, making it perfect for anyone looking to learn more about Africa in an interactive way.

I created this game because I am passionate about African culture and history. I've also recently returned from a study abroad/internatial residency in South Africa. I wanted to build a game that showcased some misconceptions about Africa in a fun interactive way. I also wanted to educate people about the rich and diverse heritage of the African continent.
